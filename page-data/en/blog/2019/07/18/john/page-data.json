Without any doubt, every single individuals and company started to have an interest in search result since they want to reveal their capabilities and specialties. Now people do not need to memorize all the knowledge. Instead, they can search just like selecting books on the bookshelves, and easily get the expertise-level information.</p>\n<p>The companies actively reacted to a consumers’ behavioral change. As the searching has become more important, contents agencies have set the number of hits and comments as a measure of short-term online influence with providing trendy contents or noticeable keywords. Then, are those measures genuinely helpful in enhancing one’s online influence? If that so, absolutely enterprises, which invest the most on ads, will be the winner of the online market.\nBut that doesn’t mean the searched contents can be ignored. If the consumers cannot acquire satisfying information or knowledge for specific objects such as figures or firms, they will stop putting their trust in the source of the data. In contrast, the consumers feel credible on such things: a blog that provides specific knowledge constantly, a figure who has been exposed to media, and a firm’s website that shows the progress of how it develops its services. About this phenomenon, a copywriter Byunggwang Choi said in his book [21century Shakespeare is born in a web]:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The power of the internet is more than we may imagine. We just see the internet in the range of our short sight because we did not realize and catch the opportunities yet…Therefore, the internet can be defined as ‘a world expands as we realize’.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the power of the internet become more powerful as people use it, an evaluation towards one people is changed through the number of contents. It means that in the connected world of online created contents can be the standard of one’s evaluation instead of an individual’s academic backgrounds or careers. Thus, people should verify their capability in the form of contents, and it needs to be disclosed through searching. In the modern world, human beings exist by creating contents online. Furthermore, they can be excluded from most of the social and financial activities unless they are connected to the internet. Already we spend a great part of our lives in cyberspace such as communication, payment, education, and leisure time. This characteristic is identically applied to an enterprise, organization, product, or brand.</p>\n<p>A company should ceaselessly create firm-relevant contents. Though all the public can access to the contents, a value of the information may vary according to their demand because there are various public groups like future customers, potential investors, or job seekers. Then what kinds of contents the firm should create? According to Heunggyu Kim and Juhyeong Park, from ‘the model of public usage of enterprise blog’, they said that</p>\n<p>“Firms started to realize the importance of segmented enterprise blog to gratify consumer’s needs and subdivide the object. Especially, they actively provide contents that can draw the attention of consumers, and naturally increase the firms’ and product brands’ likeability.”</p>\n<p>However, there is a danger that the contents focusing on public attention may be faltered by external circumstances such as fads or trends. In other words, the firm can put more effort into voguish contents, which can easily draw public interest. About this side-effect, Sangchun Park, the professor of Hanyang University, mentioned that “A meaning or value of the original forms can be buried by those contents”</p>\n<p>An identity of contents will lightly be changed by the outside world unless its intention and object are settled. If all the contents follow the fads or trends, also it will diminish a general characteristic of contents ecosystem. Besides, if all the focus is on the exposure of contents, only the firms with large capital will affect. Companies should present themselves not depending on their cost structure. Using creative tools like PC or smartphones, each of them has to find their own identity and buckle down to provide contents to show it. Above all, the contents should be perpetually loved and searched by consumers. </p>\n<p>Readers, the consumers of the content, have a will to achieve some specific goals by searching. By comparing the result of the search, they can find the contents that are more valuable than the others are. If a particular firm’s contents are continuously perceived to be worthy, consumers will recognize not only the contents itself but also the firm as an expert group. The identity of the firm should be established during this process. Undoubtedly, the group’s object, philosophy or achievements need to be combined in the contents, but we need to notice that consumers are the one who completes it. On this point, we can figure out contents should be created focusing on customer’s aspect, not on producer’s eyes. The consumers expect a certain action from the enterprise, and it can be seen as implicit consent between two. Thus, assuming that the firms live up to the contents consumers’ expectation, they may become loyal customers. </p>\n<p>In a nutshell, when a firm sends its message by constantly providing knowledge in a certain area and if it satisfies consumers’ needs, it leads to a creation of market value. As a result, an identity of the enterprise is completed through fulfilling their promises. Therefore, the firm should define, understand, and fulfill intrinsic promises. For instance, in the case of an online hobby class platform, the service needs to promise to provide a fast and convenient online environment, and this procedure should be exposed by the contents. Moreover, expectations from the buyers have to connect to fast and convenient online hobby class. To show those considerations, habitual efforts of organization members need to be known through contents. In this sense, we planned to create Technology Blog, and show how we have evolved the system.   </p>\n<p>Technology blogs aim to introduce how a firm has built its service, and it was mainly operated by IT-field startups. The process of building its service is differentiated components since the procedures are different depends on each enterprise though development tools or languages are almost the same. Because of these reasons, we can conclude that the technology blogs are ‘a digital media operates to show the service firm’s specialty in a certain area through telling about its technological skills and members’ work process.’</p>\n<p>The functions of technology blogs are largely divided into three parts; storing a process of building its service, educating new employees, PR for recruitments. Firstly, since keeping the progress of a firm’s service construction as a form of contents reflects the evolvement of service chronically, it can show the company’s specialty in a certain field and capabilities of developers. Secondly, new employees can search prior development problems or further effective plans in technology blogs. If they meet some service troubles, the staffs will cope with it shortly through the given information. Lastly, technology blogs let job seekers who have an interest in the firm to know about the development team’s tasks and their culture. Visitors to technology blogs evaluate the firm by looking through several contents; it means that the contents itself affect job seekers rather than a payment report or balance sheet.</p>\n<p> However, unlike ad marketing, technology blogs cannot be completed in short-term, and it takes time to get credits from contents consumers since a quantity of contents is inadequate at first step though its UI or accessibility is good enough. Because of the reason above, a company staff should constantly share their knowledge and information based on the experience in a particular field. Hoyeong Lee and Sahyuk Kim defined it as a ‘Reputation capital’, and argued it as an essential asset.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A reputation capital is a sort of cultural asset, which can be transformed into physical or non-physical benefits as time goes on…. For a firm, an evaluation is ‘an intangible asset’ that helps to create values.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, a reputation capital considers ‘how we can deliver helpful knowledge to contents consumers’ rather than ‘how many contents need to be exposed in a searching result’. Peter F.Drucker, the father of modern management, mentioned that knowledge could not produce anything unless it is translated into a particular model.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In intellectual society, expert knowledge is the most basic factor of production for each individual and all over the economy… Even there is a lot of specialty knowledge; it cannot create anything by itself. The expertise is only productive when it is connected to a particular task.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The created contents should be continuously exposed to the public, and give help to increase productivity and bring some results. Since the expertise is ‘a basic factor of production’, the whole developers need to involve in contents creation task. Therefore, developers have to understand their task completely and share their expertise with not only their colleagues but also unknown public. In this sense, technology blogs give responsibility to developers to provide their idea, knowledge or concepts in online. The first task to be done by developers through uploading contents is individual growth. Moreover, they should improve or innovate existing tasks. Ultimately, the online reputation of a firm will increase when it contributes to other’s productivity growth. </p>\n<p>I mentioned that technology blogs might give help to other’s productivity growth. On the other hand, what will happen if a firm does not upload its contents in the technology blog? The process of service construction is invisible; there is no new knowledge to be searched; it is hard to prepare education materials if new development tools appear. Thus, not uploading contents on the firm’s technology blog means that the will of constructing developers’ knowledge system and spontaneous effort to learn is decreased. Blog visitors do not concern whether the developers are too busy; Contents itself just matter to them. </p>\n<p>Perhaps, operating a technology blog seems to be looking for trouble. However, a direction of evaluation is determined from the moment an online channel of a firm is opened. Evaluation is constructed even the firm is not uploading any contents, though they provide some valuable information periodically. If contents consumers cannot find satisfying contents or check the last content was uploaded a long time ago, they will look for other blogs. Simultaneously, the possibility to visit the blog will be diminished.</p>\n<p>Technology blogs made by some big enterprises or start-ups have become a great mode to show their progress of service development, yet there is no optimal methodology about how to operate or manage the blogs. Also, as the importance of blogs may shrink by a heavy workload, only a few blogs such as Naver Labs, IBM Developer (KR), and Brandy Labs are continuously operated in Korea. Class101dev wants to document the evolvement, which developers have struggled to improve the service by using their expertise. By creating the blog that contains the progress of the firm, we wish people to know that CLASS101 is not only providing hobby classes but also making a platform with a group of excellent technology experts. With building up contents, we will certainly find promising developers who will thrive with CLASS101 professionally and culturally.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Books</strong><br>\n게리 켈러·제이 파파산, 구세희 역, 《원씽》, 비즈니스북스, 2013.<br>\n데이비드 미어먼 스코트, 김영배 역, 《온라인에서 팔아라》, 이실MBA, 2008.<br>\n리드 호프먼·벤 캐스노차, 차백만 역, 《어떻게 나를 최고로 만드는가》, RHK, 2012.<br>\n린다 그래튼, 조성숙 역, 《일의 미래》, 생각연구소, 2012.<br>\n마이클 바스카, 최윤영 역, 《큐레이션》, 예문아카이브, 2016.<br>\n마크 제프리, 김성아 역, 《마케팅 평가 바이블》. 전략시티, 2015.<br>\n스리람 나라얀, 홍유숙 역, 《에자일 조직혁명》, 처음북스, 2017.<br>\n앤 핸들리·C.C. 채프먼, 정수진 역, 《콘텐츠 룰》, 제이펍, 2012.<br>\n장근우, 《콘텐츠의 정석》, 예문아카이브, 2017.<br>\n조연심·김태진, 《300프로젝트》, 카시오페아, 2014.<br>\n조 풀리지·로버트 로즈, 박상훈 역, 《킬링마케팅》, 21세기북스, 2018.<br>\n찰스 핸디, 강혜정 역, 《포트폴리오 인생》, 에이지21, 2008.<br>\n최병광, 《21세기 셰익스피어는 웹에서 탄생한다》, 책이있는풍경, 2010.<br>\n피터 드러커, 이재규 역, 《프로페셔널의 조건》, 청림출판, 2001.<br>\n피터 드러커, 피터 드러커 소사이어티 역, 《피터 드러커 일의 철학》, 청림출판, 2018.<br>\n피터 드러커, 안세민 역, 《새로운 경제 사회의 경영》, 청림출판, 2014.</p>\n<p><strong>Dissertation and academic data</strong><br>\n김지수, 〈1인 미디어, 블로그의 확산과 이슈〉, 《정보통신방송정책》, 16권 22호, 정보통신정책연구원, 2004, pp.31-43.<br>\n김택현·임좌상·정철용, 〈정보공유를 위한 기업내 블로그 성공요인에 관한 실증연구〉, 《기업경영연구》, 35권 0호, 한국기업경영학회, 2010, pp.207-224.<br>\n김흥규·박주형, 〈기업 블로그 이용에 대한 공중 유형 연구〉, 《한국광고홍보학보》, 제11권 4호, 한국광고홍보학회, 2009, pp.208-239.<br>\n백승록, 〈인터넷 상의 소비자 구전활동 동기에 대한 탐색적 연구〉, 《한국광고홍보학보》, 제7권 제1호, 한국광고홍보학회, 2005, pp.108-144.<br>\n성주염, 〈브랜드 프로모션 사이트에서 웹 아이덴티티와 브랜드 이미지의 상관관계 연구〉, 《기초조형학연구》, 7권 3호, 한국기초조형학회, 2006, pp.325-333.<br>\n이호영·김사혁, 〈온라인 평판시스템의 사회적 영향력〉, 《KISDI 이슈리포트》, 2010권 2호, 정보통신정책연구원, 2010, pp.1-42.<br>\n이호영 외, 〈온라인 평판시스템의 순기능 제고 방안〉, 《정책연구》, 2009권 67호, 정보통신정책연구원, 2009, pp.1-161.<br>\n정은복, 〈기업 블로그 정보품질이 재방문/구전에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구〉, 《한국광고홍보학보》, 제12권 제4호, 한국광고홍보학회, 2010, pp.43-72.<br>\n최환진, 〈대학생의 블로그, 미니홈피 이용 동기와 이용 과정에 대한 연구〉, 《광고학연구》, 제17권 3호, 한국광고학회, 2006, pp.225-248.<br>\n한상기, 〈뉴미디어시대 경영: 기업 블로그의 중요성에 대해 다시 생각하자〉, 《월간 경영계》, 402권 0호, 한국경영자총협회, 2012, pp.40-41.</p>\n<p><strong>Website</strong><br>\n〈ᄀᄋᄃ… ᄈᄇᄏᄐ 싹뚝, 축약의 시대〉, 《조선비즈》, 2018.08.24. 참조.
